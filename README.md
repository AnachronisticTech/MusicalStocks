# MusicalStocks

A small macOS/iOS application to retrieve stock prices and convert them to music!

NOTE: You need an API key from [here](https://finnhub.io) to get stocks data. You can apply the key by inserting it as the value of `Constants.finnhubSandboxAPIKey` in `Shared/StockPriceDownloader.swift`.
